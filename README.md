How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I interprit users needs by communicating with them to find out what is missing and then I will work in required stories with user stories to create a better product
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I approach by using the pizza rule to create a large enough team to work well but no too large that it is out of hand. I will then inmplement agile to run every aspect   of the team
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Always show up with you best and be prepared to help anyone who needs it.
